# ToDo
* Some error handling would be nice
* Add support for arguments to specify whether you want to build core or apps (and which apps).
* Hide the building and display status information, like easyefl.sh
* Merge build-e18.sh and build-e18-apps.sh into one script.
* Generally make it useable for people other than myself
