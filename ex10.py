"""Introduction to Python - Exercise 10

Long Decimals
* On paper, 0.1+0.2=0.3. But you have seen that in Python,
0.1+0.2=0.30000000000000004.
* Find at least one other calculation that results in a long decimal like this.
"""

print 3 * 0.1

# Python returned 0.3 for me but it was supposed to return 0.30000000000000004
# I need to work out why.
